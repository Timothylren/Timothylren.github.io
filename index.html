        <p>Hello! Welcome to my homepage, where you can get a grasp of what kind of person I am and some experiences I had before. While portfolio and resume covers most of my career/study related experienece, I want to use this space to tell you about me more. I like a lot of things. I enjoy music. I started playing clarinet since I was 10. Although I was laying back a bit on practicing clarinet since college, I think I am still a decent clarinet player. I like games. In my portfolio you can see one of the games I created with my group. I enjoyed the process of designing and coding that game a lot. </p>
